# REPORT GENERATOR
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/4k8nk3BPurE
#### Description:
This program takes in a specific type of file in excel generated from a program called Cribmaster and returns a completed and saved file to be generated and emailed out to a specific recipient.
  
It is written in VBA and is used to let a series of people know how much product was used from vending machines from the prior week. This is used as a work application and used what I learned from this course to create and further my career.
  
When creating this program, it was written and re-written several times to make up what I find to be the easiest way to understand. Originally, it was written very poorly but achieved the results I wanted to then through refactoring the code I believe it has been throughly optimized for this particular application.
  
When designing the program, first I wrote the entire program that entailed every step I wanted to accomplish however, as the program grew in size however I found that it was starting to become really difficult to understand and follow. This is when I rewrote it with separate functions that would be able to clearly outline the sections of the program.
  
If I were to rewrite the code in Python, my next steps for recreating would be to have this in separate files and become more universal as well as an updater and installer for the program as I've utilized it for my entire company at this point and having the extra functionality would be nice if it was in a more widely used language. Perhaps to be done with an upgrade to Microsoft 365 platform.
